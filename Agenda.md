## Additional Skills:

1. **Typescript**
   - For web development: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making it easier to catch errors during development and improving code quality.
   - Enhanced React development: TypeScript's static typing integrates seamlessly with React, resulting in better developer experience, easier debugging, and more maintainable code.
   - Scalability: TypeScript is well-suited for larger projects, as the static typing and improved tooling support help manage complexity and maintain code consistency.
   - Increased productivity: TypeScript's advanced features, such as interfaces and type annotations, lead to improved code completion, refactoring capabilities, and overall development productivity.
   - Growing popularity: TypeScript has gained widespread adoption among developers and companies, so learning it will increase your marketability and help you stay current with industry trends.

2. **Python**
